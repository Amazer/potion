        * Asynchronous non-blocking IO in the aio module via libuv. So like

        eg. max 15 on amd64
        * Fixed GC errors when running out of memory
        * Added support for 3 -DJ disassemblers
        * Changed dir layout, seperate bin and lib/potion, use .y for syntax
        * Improved build system (PIC and static, faster auto-configure, ...)
        * Use Travis testing
        * khash.h updated to 0.2.6
        * greg updated to 0.4.5 with error blocks, lineno, -DPp support
