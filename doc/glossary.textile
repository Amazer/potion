See "start":start.html for an overview of the syntax and data structures.

tuple: an ordered list

table: a hash

lick:  a nested data structure, i.e. named hash. the keys are called path.

Every lick can have a name, a table of attributes, and a list of
children. The list of children can, instead, be a Potion data
type, such as a number or string or something.

path:  key of a lick, an instance variable of an object.

Paths cannot be randomly added to the object after the object
is created. Each object has a strict set of paths. Every path
which is used in the constructor is added to the object upon
creation.

upval: A variable in an upper scope.

Since a closure doesn't have access to the registers
of another function, these variables are passed
as pointers (the PNWeakRef struct.)

Lobby: potion called the main interp object Lobby, which holds the
methods about, here, exit, self, ...
p2 renames it to P2
